# Data-Mining-on-Wine
## Overview
This repository contains the documentation and methodology for a data mining project on red and white wine datasets. The project aims to:
	1.	Predict Wine Quality: Using physicochemical properties to predict wine quality.
	2.	Classify Wine Type: Differentiating between red and white wines based on their physicochemical attributes.

The analysis was conducted using various data mining techniques and tools, with a focus on statistical modeling and machine learning.

## How to Use
1.	Download the Wine_Data_Mining_Analysis.docx file.
2.	Open the file using a Word processor (e.g., Microsoft Word, Google Docs).
3.	Follow the step-by-step guide in the document to:
    - Understand the methodology.
	  - Review the results of the analysis.

## Project Highlights
1. Datasets: Red and white wine datasets with over 6,000 rows of data.
2. Key Features: Physicochemical properties such as acidity, pH, and alcohol content.
3. Tools Used: SAS Enterprise Miner, R Studio, and Excel for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
4. Evaluation Metrics:
	-	Misclassification Rate
	-	ROC Index
	-	Root Average Squared Error (RASE)
  - Accuracry
  - Precision
  - F1-Score

## Results
The document provides a detailed summary of:
	-	Model performances for predicting wine quality.
	-	Feature importance analysis to identify the most influential factors.
	-	Classification accuracy for differentiating wine types.
