# Wine Data Mining Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing physicochemical properties of wine to predict wine quality and classify wine types. By leveraging data mining techniques, we aim to uncover insights for better wine production and quality control.

## Features
- **Predictive Modeling:** Built models to predict wine quality based on its chemical attributes.  
- **Classification:** Differentiated between red and white wines using machine learning techniques.  
- **Feature Analysis:** Identified key attributes influencing wine quality and type.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Data Mining Tools:** SAS Enterprise Miner
- **Visualization:** SAS Studio Graph  

## Key Contributions
- Conducted end-to-end data mining, from preprocessing to evaluation.  
- Evaluated models using metrics such as Misclassification Rate, ROC Index, RASE for prediction of quality of wine while Accuracy, Precision and F1-score for classification of red wine and white wine.  
- Provided actionable insights into factors affecting wine quality and classification.
